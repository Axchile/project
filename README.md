-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two types of fruit:

Non-flashing fruit: Worth 10 points; Flashing fruit: Gives snake a speed boost

If the snake touches itself, the game is over. 
As the snake eats more fruits, it becomes difficult to control as it grows longer and longer.
The goal is to get the highest score possible. The sessionâ€™s score and highest score is shown on top of the screen.
